# Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the problems from Project Euler, a collection of computational problems aimed at honing programming and mathematical skills.

## Introduction

Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/) provides a series of challenging problems that involve various mathematical concepts and algorithms. Each problem encourages participants to find efficient solutions and optimize their code for performance.

## Structure

- Each problem solution is organized into its own directory, labeled with the corresponding problem number.
- The solutions are implemented in JavaScript.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eliptik1/project-euler
```

2. Navigate to the directory:

```bash
cd project-euler
```

3. Run the solution using Node.js:

```bash
node problem-X.js
```

## Introduction
These solutions are provided for educational purposes. While I strive for efficiency, there might be alternative solutions or optimizations. Feel free to explore, learn, and suggest improvements.
